_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This network data set comprises two versions of a biological
     network in which the nodes are operons in _Escherichia Coli_ and a
     directed edge from one node to another indicates that the first
     encodes the transcription factor that regulates the second.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     data(ecoli)
     
_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The network object 'ecoli1' is directed, with 423 nodes and 519
     arcs. The object 'ecoli2' is an undirected version of the same
     network, in which all arcs are treated as edges and the five
     isolated nodes (which exhibit only self-regulation in 'ecoli1')
     are removed, leaving 418 nodes.

     When publishing results obtained using this data set, the original
     authors (Salgado et al, 2001; Shen-Orr et al, 2002) should be
     cited, along with this 'R' package.

_S_o_u_r_c_e:

     The data set is based on the RegulonDB network (Salgado et al,
     2001) and was modified by Shen-Orr et al (2002).
